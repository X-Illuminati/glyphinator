 * Usage:
 * Include this file with the "use" tag.
 * Depends on compat.scad library.
 *
 * API:
 *   1dbitmap(bitmap, center, expansion, vector_mode)
 *   2dbitmap(bitmap, center, expansion, vector_mode)
 *     Generate a 1 or 2-Dimensional field of modules based on the provided
 *     bitmap vector. See Bitmap Vectors below.
 *     The center flag determines whether to center the bitmap on the origin.
 *     The expansion value actually shrinks each cube in the x and y
 *     dimension by the specified amount.
 *     The vector_mode flag determines whether to create 3D solid geometry
 *     (unit cubes) or 2D vector geometry (squares).
 *
 * Bitmap Vectors:
 *   The bitmap vectors primarily provide boolean information.
 *   A module will be placed where these vectors have a postive value and
 *   skipped where they have a negative value. I.E. 0, -1, false, and undef
 *   are all equivalent and result in a skip. 1 and true are equivalent and
 *   result in a placed 1-unit module.
 *   Further, if the value is an integer it will be treated as a height for
 *   the module, allowing z-maps to be created.
 *   If the value is not an integer or boolean, it will be treated as a color
 *   reference. This can be a string or RGBA vector that will be used to
 *   color the module in the OpenSCAD preview window.
 *   In current versions of OpenSCAD, the color has no effect in the rendered
 *   view or STL output.
 *
 * Vector Mode:
 *   Although OpenSCAD supports generating 2D geometry, there are several
 *   caveats:
 *   - 2D and 3D geometry cannot be mixed
 *   - Extruding 2D geometry causes color information to be lost
 *   - All 2D geometry is projected onto the XY plane when rendering
 *   - Rendering also results in loss of color (same as 3D)
 *   - The SVG exporter is somewhat limited:
 *     - The pixel size of the image is hard-coded in the file
 *     - The title of the image is a generic string
 *     - The color selection for stroke and fill is fixed
 *     - The stroke-width is set to a large value that will cause overlap
 *     - The background is transparent
 *     - Only one path element is created with all of the geometry; there is
 *       no easy way to split up the geometry into multiple logical units.
 *     - These issues can mostly be resolved by hand-editing the file:
 *       - Remove or modify the width and height parameters from the svg
 *         element at the top of the file to provide better scaling.
 *       - Edit the title element at the top of the file to change the title.
 *       - Edit the stroke and fill parameters of the path element (these will
 *         probably be at the end of the file).
 *       - Set the stroke-width parameter for the path element to 0.
